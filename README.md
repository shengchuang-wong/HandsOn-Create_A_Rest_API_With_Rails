#### Troubleshooting
- If libssl error is presented, try `brew reinstall openssl@1.1`
This suggestion also solved the issue with the same error
Mac OSX, with Catalina 10.15.3, running mysql 8.0.19, using Rails 5.2 (for what its worth) and already had openssl 1.1.1d installed with Homebrew.

gem uninstall mysql2
brew upgrade openssl
gem install mysql2 -- --with-opt-dir="$(brew --prefix openssl)"
